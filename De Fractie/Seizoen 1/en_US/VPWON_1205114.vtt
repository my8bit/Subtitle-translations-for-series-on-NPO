00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.030
Mr. Snel! Mr. Snel!

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.120
Were you immediately welcome to the VPN? Good conversations have preceded it.

4
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.090
I immediately felt at home. Is it betrayal? I choose an ideal.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.070
If that is betrayal, then I do not understand it anymore.

6
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.180
I strive for an open Netherlands with individual freedom, without senseless patronizing.

7
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.150
And the VPN shares my dream. You are a dreamer?

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.100
But I'm not the only one.

9
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.200
Tim simply belongs to the VPN. Point.

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.030
You were a talent with a large group and you switch to ...

11
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.020
a small party that has nothing reached. It is our intention that we will now achieve a lot.

12
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.140
This is just a turn? No, I keep heading.

13
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.170
Does the switch have to do with the sudden death of your father?

14
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.090
If you lose one of your parents, everything has to do with it.

15
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.010
Thank you.

16
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.160
Now you do it again. Zwarte Piet is black.

17
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.060
Sinterklaas exists. I am called for flapdrol.

18
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.160
And the bonuses. I feel like it. Deeply tragic for our country.

19
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.030
You know my name now. You are not yet away from me.

20
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.100
Then we will arrange it. Good evening. That requires money.

21
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
That VOC mentality! I'm done with it. Did not think so.

22
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.060
Here I refuse to listen. This is plainly disgusting. Yet?!

23
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.170
Even dimming. Also your car, Mrs Halsema. Hup, walk.

24
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.030
Yes. WOMAN:People will have a time left. And not always nice.

25
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.020
I think it's brave of you. Well, they do not eat me up.

26
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.010
But you have to have an elephant skin . Your father always said ...

27
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.010
Mom ... It's just bad ...

28
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.070
Yes, I understand. Sorry dear.

29
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.120
Let's have lunch this afternoon. Good? You do not have time.

30
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.130
I have to eat once. I'll take the train later.

31
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.050
Okay, until this afternoon.

32
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.170
MESSAGE MOBILE PHONE

33
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.130
Oh, sorry. Good morning. Good morning.

34
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.190
Hey, good morning. Hey.

35
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.210
I'm looking for Cynthia Goedig. Cynthia. End of the corridor on the left.

36
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.110
Cynthia Good? Tim Snel.

37
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.060
Welcome. Thank you. Are you coming along? Yes.

38
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.030
Vincent, the press officer . The kitchen.

39
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.030
Post and sir ...

40
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.110
Ahhh, you are here! Come on in.

41
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.170
Hai. Hai. Cynthia is the mother of the group. Coffee? Yummy.

42
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.120
No, we'll take it in the hallway. Are you calling everyone?

43
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.240
Okay, just pay attention all ...

44
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.160
Today we have:Tim Snel.

45
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:03.090
During the Christmas break, he joined our party, with Kamerzetel and al.

46
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.160
A huge surprise. Maybe you can say something short about it?

47
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.190
Eh, hello.

48
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.070
Well, we've already seen each other in the Chamber. And in the committees.

49
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.010
But I am Tim Snel.

50
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.020
I chose you because the VPN is the only club that really wants to change something. Yes!

51
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.040
We bring democracy to the 21st century.

52
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.210
No moralizing state intervention . And my favorite:

53
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.060
Wealth tax . Reform of the tax. Yes.

54
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.220
A complete revolution. You are good at that! (!)

55
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.130
I am extremely grateful to Jan, our chairman ...

56
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.200
and of course Marise. Thanks.

57
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.210
I will not confuse your trust. Tim gets the wallet finances.

58
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.160
Ohh! You are going to tackle the bank bobos!

59
00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.040
We're going to hear a lot of that. Good, at work.

60
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.000
The press is already eager. Keep it a while away.

61
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.220
Cynthia, do you point to Tim's new place? Press conference Rutte later.

62
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.050
Do you know what he's going to say? Mee.

63
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.090
Have you already sent out the message about Tim? Before you were awake.

64
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.070
Comments? Very much.

65
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.220
Very predictable. Does not matter.

66
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.130
Have you seen the headlines? Yes. We need something with that. Not now.

67
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.110
Well now. It is playing now. You want to be relevant.

68
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.170
Rutte. What did you catch?

69
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.060
The Cabinet wants a bizarre gas plan. It seems to be mega. Hm.

70
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.150
The media are angling, but do not say anything. Other parties?

71
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.140
Nada. What are you ...? Close the door once.

72
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.070
This is just for you.

73
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.180
I made a deal with Rutte.

74
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.140
Free childcare.

75
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.030
We have been fighting for two years. Prepare a press release.

76
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.140
But seriously:No word yet, no one.

77
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.170
Here is Corine.

78
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.150
And I had this in mind for you.

79
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.210
You already have my wallet. In this case, my desk.

80
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.020
O, no. That's not necessary. Is there no place where I can sit down?

81
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.130
You brought your own chair?

82
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.230
My Room Seat . Then you can sit on it.

83
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.040
Good.

84
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.220
From me.

85
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.210
I thought you would be happy. We are also.

86
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.060 Condoned
with your father.

87
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.230
Thank you.

88
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.150
Does it hurt?

89
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.180
Yes. Only when I sit still.

90
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.150
Yes, working hard helps.

91
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.030
What do you have with you, dude? I'm moving.

92
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.210
I found a place in The Hague:20th floor, beautiful view.

93
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.100
It's still a bit messy. But close, so that's handy ...

94
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.080
... for the job.

95
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.010
Good morning. Tomorrow! Good morning.

96
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.040
Thank you, thank you ...

97
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.100
It's not there yet, is it, Cynthia?

98
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.180
It's cold here.

99
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.140
Okay!

100
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.060
Are we all here?

101
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.120
Does anyone know where Leendert is? So. Toilet.

102
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.130
And Jan is not awake either. That goes well (!)

103
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.010
Cynthia, do you want to close the door?

104
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.120
And there is Leendert.

105
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.230
Agenda is short today.

106
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.040
Ehh ... REPORTING And there is Jan.

107
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.000
Good morning. Good morning! Just in time.

108
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.100
Wow. Do you always do that?

109
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.210
No one has our technology.

110
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.180
MOBILE TELEPHONE Today the Rutte holds a press conference.

111
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.190
Very ambitious new plan.

112
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.190
I have negotiated intensively with him during the past recess. Our commitment was:

113
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.170
Free child care, accessible to everyone.

114
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.120
And it's inside! CRACES OF AMAZING

115
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:12.170
That's great! Breakthrough for working women! And men. Yes.

116
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.060
And a fulfilled election promise.

117
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.240
What is it about? That can not be a trifle.

118
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.150
Marise, can you do Pauw tonight or Nieuwsuur? Wait.

119
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.000
Will the national debt rise or will we pay more tax? Can I have a moment?

120
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.240
This is the gas extraction area in Groningen. Here are the tremors and subsidence.

121
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.050
Here one wonders how to proceed. They want security.

122
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.180
And rightly so. That drilling continues, we can not do otherwise.

123
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.120
The whole country depends on that gas.

124
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:48.040
The Netherlands will never give up the natural gas. Never. No.

125
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:53.200
You can not say that. Whether we do it quickly or slowly, those tremors will continue to come.

126
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.240
And that is too much uncertainty for the people here.

127
00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.230
The government wants to offer them a new future somewhere else.

128
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.170
And we will support that.

129
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.120
My parents live there!

130
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.240
Here! HERE they live!

131
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.140
My aunt HERE and my best friend from primary school HERE.

132
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:21.080
This is where I come from! These are my people! Please, Corine ...

133
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:26.120
So we are going to expropriate that area and we get childcare in return?

134
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:30.070
Free childcare from two years, for the whole country.

135
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:35.070
Do you know how many people this is, Yes, about 20,000. 20,000 people!

136
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.230
With a day at Pinkpop there are three times as many.

137
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:42.040
Is it already known how we are going to pay this? Stop talking about the money!

138
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:46.220
Free childcare is incredibly important for millions of workers.

139
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.220
For the freedom of women and for the economy.

140
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.080
People live in Groningen, Marise!

141
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.000 You
have to take that into account. But not our voters.

142
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.030
What do others think? The CDA?

143
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.000
The CDA is against farmers, then you know.

144
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:06.110
The SP or the ChristenUnie. SP does not want to, ChristenUnie just want the woman at home.

145
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.150
The question is whether it is affordable and I do not think so.

146
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.220
Free childcare costs billions. Yes.

147
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.050
And then you have to expropriate another 20,000 people in Groningen.

148
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.240
Say three people per house has been rounded up to 7,000 homes.

149
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.160
7050.

150
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.220 Do
the average price in that region, Corine?

151
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.140
2 tons. 2 tons?

152
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.080
Well, that's 1.4 billion.

153
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:34.220
1.41. And then you have to build another 7,000 new homes, another 1.4 billion.

154
00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.010
The moving costs alone

155
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.140
If that continues, I will start a moving company that I know.

156
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.150
How are we going to pay this? From the future gas revenues.

157
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.100
That money has long since gone. No, that's new money.

158
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:50.030
Because we do not have to take the residents into account, we can pump harder.

159
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.040
Do you have any idea what this looks like on TV?

160
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.210
Thanks to the VPN! Corine ...

161
00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.170
Furious people who scream, cry, who grieve!

162
00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:05.170
They are not all expropriated at once, but ONE for ONE and after a while gets used to that.

163
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.090
Oh, you get used to that? Yes.

164
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.150
My aunt of 80 is taken out of her house by the ME ...

165
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:17.150
so that the bakfietstrutten their Julius and Sterre will be able to dump free of charge.

166
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.130
We are going to be very popular with it as a party.

167
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.060
If you want to become popular, you have to take part in The Voice of Holland.

168
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.070
Katja, stop.

169
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.240
Katja.

170
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.090
We are not afraid to show leadership.

171
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.070
To make choices. Sustainable choices.

172
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.160
I can not explain this at home. Sorry, sustainable?

173
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.180
I fought hard for this deal.

174
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.150
Childcare, we promised our voters.

175
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.130
Can you imagine what this means for the Netherlands?

176
00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.090
For our future? For us?

177
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.070
Soon Slochteren will be empty and then?

178
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.230
Once the time has come, we also focus on renewable energy.

179
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.090
Think of all those jobs that yields!

180
00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:02.080
Things we've been fighting for years, you too, Corine, you know that.

181
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.040
Look.

182
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:13.000
We would not be the VPN if we did not perform this in a humane, elegant way.

183
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:18.110
I admit:The gas plan does not yet deserve the beauty prize, so let me buy some time.

184
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.010
I can take such good steps now.

185
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.040
We invest in the future:our children.

186
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:30.220
We never get a better chance than this.

187
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.050
I can now claim this with your support.

188
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:39.000
With all due respect, Marise, but do not you have to think this through again?

189
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:52.100
What I mean is:Do not we have to calculate this correctly?

190
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:56.110
Thank you, Tim, for your keen insight.

191
00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:02.210
And yes, financially it is elaborated in detail, we can use it well.

192
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:09.050
Corine, I would really like you to have that debate later on.

193
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:20.110
Beautiful. I am glad we find each other again on the importance of childcare.

194
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.160
Everybody sharp:If these plans are announced ...

195
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:28.070
we are only talking about free childcare, VPN makes the difference, etcetera.

196
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.010
32.010 This is still a voting round. Yes. We suspend.

197
00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:37.160
Mouth outside the door, no one knows this yet and I do not feel like uncontrolled waking.

198
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:39.080
Are you waiting?

199
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.140
The law of Plasterk will not work.

200
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:13.120
The Balkenende standard is far too low, everyone knows that.

201
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.110
So we are disappointed? No, we are for it.

202
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.120
That's an open wound in the coalition, we're throwing salt into it.

203
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:21.120
We have to get rid of the Balkenende standard. Do you want the Rutte standard?

204
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:24.050
That's brilliant. Self-conceived?

205
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.060
No, Tim.

206
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.030
Mrs Collee!

207
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.070
The hassle about top salaries is mainly a decline for Minister Plasterk.

208
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.240
Even though not the strongest minister ... Tim Snel started today in your group.

209
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.130
His transfer is seen as betrayal. How is that in the group?

210
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:47.160
Tim stayed true to his ideals and there is a lot of respect for this in the group and in the country.

211
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:54.140
But we do not stop, free will ... Tim Snel has ideals ... Any questions?

212
00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:57.200
Are you afraid of tensions in your group by Tim Snel?

213
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.160
We are very happy with a motivated new colleague.

214
00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:05.070
From whom we have to see if he strengthens or weakens the group.

215
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.080
He's pretty nice? Pretty nice?

216
00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.030
It causes unrest, have not you listened?

217
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.020
Not so negative, Michael, you are not.

218
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.040
Did I miss something? Not yet.

219
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.220
I'm sorry that I picked up your desk.

220
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.140
My place is not important, I can sit anywhere. Me too.

221
00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.080
We noticed that.

222
00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.070
I am an open book. Joh.

223
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:33.050
I come from another party, from another city and move here, to you.

224
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.120
One of the qualities I value in people ...

225
00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.040
is loyalty.

226
00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:43.000
Jan may be happy with your transfer, it is not me.

227
00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:48.040
I can not ignore that. If you stay that way straight forward, that does not have to be a problem.

228
00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.100
HE SPEAKS ENGLISH:Michael. Sorry?

229
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:55.010
THE NETHERLANDS STATEMENT :Michael. Yes, Michael, sorry, yes.

230
00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.030
I get it. Hard, new names and stuff.

231
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.040
If you do your best, you'll get out.

232
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.000
I still have a seat. Where is Marise?

233
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:07.170
is coming.

234
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.180
A chair.

235
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.140
MOBILE

236
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.060
Yes?

237
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:20.070
An interview? In fifteen minutes. Yes, I can. With whom?

238
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.160
Rutte, press conference. Yes.

239
00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.080
Jiska Willink, NOS.

240
00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.090
Marise, Rutte starts like this.

241
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.040
I do not want you today for a camera or microphone.

242
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.010
Jiska, I'll call you back.

243
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.200
There are many questions. They are still there tomorrow.

244
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.120
Today nothing should distract from the free childcare.

245
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.050
They keep whining about you.

246
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.100
I think that's over as soon as the deal becomes known.

247
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.180
I am still less important than childcare. Exactly.

248
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:51.100
For the Groningers I want to have a detailed plan before we agree.

249
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:54.230
You take care of the calculation for the press conference this afternoon.

250
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:05.170
Chair?

251
00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:27.020
Corine, it's important.

252
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.160
Well ... we are loose.

253
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.050
This is not possible?

254
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:45.220
I am chased out of the village with pitch and feathers when I come home.

255
00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.080
Corine ...

256
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:57.120
You understand that I can not simply put aside the financing of this plan?

257
00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.130
I understand that. And I give you that time.

258
00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:05.140
But if you do not drastically change the execution of the plans ...
I will lie in front of it.

259
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.180 Every step.

260
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:11.220
Corine ... Every step, Marise.

261
00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.230
So, now I like a cigarette.

262
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.200
I still have one.

263
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.210
Yes, but I do not want a cigarette at all!

264
00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:25.000
I quit smoking and then she will clear Groningen, goddamn!

265
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.100
Hee ...

266
00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.120
Were you for or against the Groningen plan?

267
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.120
Not for, in any case. Why do not you play it harder?

268
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:46.050
We need well-thought-through proposals, you just complain about money.

269
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:50.140
Everything is about money. So you are also going to do the debate about top salaries?

270
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.170
No, Marise, I think.

271
00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.190
In the case of rumblings within the coalition, that is for the chief.

272
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.090
That Balkenende standard is not for nothing?

273
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.010
The old or the new?

274
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.140
He earns 4 tons a year as a lobbyist and drives a Porsche.

275
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.150 Is not
that scandalous? Nonsense.

276
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.110
Populist balls.

277
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.230
I'm in front of the Rutte standard:2.5 tons and do not nag.

278
00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.150
Otherwise you can only prove yourself in the business world.

279
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.070
It is about the real fiddling and that remains out of the picture.

280
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.130
Follow the money. Follow the leader.

281
00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.080
What is the difference?

282
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.090
You are a follower. You do not think.

283
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.150
MOBILE

284
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.070
Mom?

285
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.030
Mr. Snel, do you support the plan to evacuate Groningen?

286
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.170
Is Mrs Collee's position under pressure?

287
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:43.090
The party fully supports Marise Collee, her position is not up for discussion.

288
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.010
Not?

289
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:53.150
Just in private with Tim. Not bad, right?

290
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.070
Also hello, Jan.

291
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.140
How you did that, just calculate, 7000 times two tons. Very well.

292
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:09.030
Marise can count, but she can not count.

293
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.130
That plan is priceless. You think so too?

294
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.140
I said that right? Then why did not you support me?

295
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.000
Because you do not think. Are you starting already?

296
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.160
You honor your name, but patience is a beautiful thing.

297
00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:25.210
I'm moving from the broom wagon to the head crank and I have to take it easy?

298
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:29.180
Then the line does not break. You must disprove the PLAN, not her.

299
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.030
It's not smart. The whole plan is not smart.

300
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.070
But you undermine your own position.

301
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.240
On day ONE.

302
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.200
Let gas plan day drain, but give her the feeling that that is her own choice.

303
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:48.090
Let Vincent come up with a spider and show you what you are worth.

304
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:56.040
Nothing like Groningen? Care for Groningen.

305
00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.220
It's not about care, it's about gas.

306
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:03.060
Groningen gives gas. That is not a spin, that's a bomb.

307
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.140
We have to make it clear that we have great plans ...

308
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:11.150
but that we have both feet on the ground.

309
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.130
Nice. Realistic and strong.

310
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.150
We know what's going on. We are not deaf or crazy.

311
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.180
This is it. Hashtag 'with both feet on the ground', top.

312
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.060
You're off too? Joe. Beautiful.

313
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.210
Was that gas deal really behind my back?

314
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:37.160
YOUR back? You pick up a guy from another group without any deliberation and drop it with me.

315
00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.200
The transfer of the century. We are not a football club.

316
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.130
We try to get our subjects on the agenda, but everything is about Tim Snel.

317
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:50.020
Do you prefer questions about what you think of Charlie Hebdo's cartoons?

318
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:54.120
Here, just out. It is an interesting thought experiment.

319
00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:57.210
France is better off with an Islamic president.

320
00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:02.020
Especially now. It is not fun for you, because this is not allowed anymore.

321
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:05.170
You have to go back into the house. Well, cozy (!)

322
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:12.030
We need something with it. We do not do anything with those fundamentalists in Staphorst?

323
00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.130
They do not shoot cartoonists. So you want to intervene?

324
00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.180
VPN makes the difference, also in the caliphate.

325
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:23.020
We have to do something about it, if only because they literally come closer.

326
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:24.230
The new Kunduz.

327
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:29.130
That's too easy, politics is not easy. Sometimes it is.

328
00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:34.180
Are they going to fight? Picking up. Hate sowing? Picking up. Furthermore, everyone can believe what he wants.

329
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:38.090
You have to keep an eye on that gas bubble, because you are being teased.

330
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.080
It's a solid deal, Rutte is not. Oh no?

331
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.130
Am I missing something here? Hey? Mark?

332
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.150
Good luck. Thank you.

333
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:56.020
The administration of the foundation Friends of the VPN, is that here?

334
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.190
At Jan. O.

335
00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.170
Should I pick something? No.

336
00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.120
Did you see this coming in?

337
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.190
Do you know where it comes from?

338
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.060
No idea.

339
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.060
Shall we? Yes.

340
00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.050
RUMOER

341
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:24.010
When they start? Yes, then I say that it is important that we offer clarity.

342
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.120
And back to childcare. For the future. Yes.

343
00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.140
Have fun. Thank you.

344
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.230
Good afternoon. Free child care ...

345
00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.150
from two years for everyone.

346
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.150 A
lot of money is needed for that.

347
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:50.210
The Netherlands has that money and space ... Where do you get the money to finance this?

348
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:55.050
Mrs Collee, does the VPN want to give up the province of Groningen?

349
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.170
The reality is that the ground will drop further there.

350
00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.230
Groningen is evacuated?

351
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:05.230
The proposal is about expropriation in a limited area and in everyone's interest.

352
00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.190
With both feet on the ground, what does that mean?

353
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.050
VPN tweet 'with both feet on the ground'.

354
00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.150
That means that we dare to face big plans ...

355
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.220
and continue to listen to society. There is room in the point of view?

356
00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.220
We dare to make big plans and continue to listen to society.

357
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.210
THEY CALL BY EACH OTHER

358
00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.030
And here I wanted to leave it at that, thank you.

359
00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.170
Yes right? What did you actually think?

360
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:45.020
'That means we dare to face big plans.'

361
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:49.180
Where does that 'with both feet on the ground' fainting ball come from? Vincent?

362
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:51.120
I thought it was strong.

363
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.100
Tim said it. Tim, you ?!

364
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.030
Jan asked if I ... Jan ?!

365
00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:01.120
Did you discuss this with Jan? When?

366
00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.200
We must radiate unity, Tim.

367
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
If you find something, you come to me. Otherwise, you'll keep your mouth shut.

368
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.210
Yes, I will pay attention.

369
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.040
SHE SLAATS WITH THE DOOR

370
00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.010
Hey Tim.

371
00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:36.150
There's a drink, are you coming?

372
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.000
I have a dinner appointment. Do you have a minute? You promised it.

373
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.120
I'll see you tomorrow. Good. Just then.

374
00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.130
He is walking.

375
00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.060
Mr. Snel, how do you like your new group?

376
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:53.230
Very good. Very happy with the atmosphere and the open culture.

377
00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:57.230
Disagreements are thrown on the table, including the sensitive issues.

378
00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.110
Like the expropriations in Groningen?

379
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.150
I just want to say that we are very free at the VPN.

380
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.170
But with questions about Groningen you have to be with Marise Collee, who knows a lot more than me.

381
00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.160
THERE IS A MOBILE What's in the suitcase?

382
00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:14.150 Gas bubbles
!

383
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.140
Yes? Yes!

384
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.110
Hello. Hi.

385
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.050
Can I have two of those ... 'sakkavoerma'.

386
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.030
Sac kavurma. Yes.

387
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:47.020
No, I'll warm myself up at home. I'm in a bit of a hurry.

388
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.050
For the gentleman in a hurry.

389
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:58.220
But very nice to have been in the Escher as well.

390
00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.100
I'm coming, I'm taking the microwave.

391
00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.110
So that's an old palace.

392
00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.030
Really beautiful!

393
00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:08.200
Well. So!

394
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.180
This is also a bit of a palace.

395
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:15.130
A little chilly, but not wrong.

396
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.190
Where is your service?

397
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.190
Mom, I have signs here.

398
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.220
Mom, sit down. I prepare the food.

399
00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.070
Just leave that junk for what it is.

400
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.080
Mom, leave it smooth, you want.

401
00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:44.000
I just help. That's not necessary. You do not have time for it?

402
00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:47.120
Will I come over the week? No, I do it myself.

403
00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:51.030
When? When I have the time. You'll notice.

404
00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.150
Just take a break. No, I'm not taking it free.

405
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.100
Priorities, you remember. Dad always talked about that.

406
00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:02.210
And I have it:I want young people to get the faith again ...

407
00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:05.170
that their children get better than they do.

408
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:10.240
It can not be that your social opportunities are determined by your zip code?

409
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.070
Everyone should have chances.

410
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.120
In education, in art, in work, in retirement.

411
00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:21.190
So that people get confidence in each other, and themselves.

412
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.170
Free from oppression, free from humiliation.

413
00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.220
That they are just free.

414
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.100
Sorry.

415
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.100
compatriots.

416
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:51.020
HIS MOBILE BUT PEEP

417
00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:03.030
The Cabinet greatly appreciates the realism of the VPN.

418
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:07.180
But first I want to think fundamentally about natural gas extraction.

419
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:10.090
And that will definitely take until after the elections.

420
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.050
And that means that crown jewel ...

421
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.170
Here we go. ... of the VPN, free childcare ...

422
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:22.000
that it does not come anyway, because it can only be paid if the gas production continues.

423
00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:23.240
Marise.

424
00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.020
Have you seen the news?

425
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.050
No gas, no childcare.

426
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:32.110
Thanks to Jan and you especially, so come here. Damage control.

427
00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:39.100
The coalition parties have no interest in it anyway, just before 21 March.

428
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:43.080
So before the Senate elections. THE MICROWAVE PEOPLE

429
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:47.160
Mr. Snel, Minister Dijsselbloem was not happy about your disclosure.

430
00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:54.120
This is not the case, the IPO of the ABN may not be a handshake between two old college friends.

431
00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.210
Do you still have confidence in the minister?

432
00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:00.230
The minister is allowed to explain if he knew this and found it no problem ...

433
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.100
or that he did not know and what consequences this has.

434
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.170
Tim, it will be nice later. This comes from the editors.

435
00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:10.230
The same two, but this one is from ABN's head office.

436
00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:13.080
Now it gets tough.
